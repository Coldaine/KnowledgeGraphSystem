# docs3/ - OBSOLETE

This directory contains **temporary merge documentation** from when two versions of the documentation were being reconciled.

## Contents (All Obsolete)
All files in this directory (`00-MERGE-SUMMARY.md`, `01-CONSTITUTION-merge.md`, etc.) were **temporary** merge recommendations that have been completed.

## Merge Status
✅ **Merge Complete** - The merge decisions documented here have been applied to the main documentation structure:
- Constitution, Contracts, and Epics adopted from upstream
- Type additions and UI philosophy integrated
- Knowledge decay concepts incorporated

## Recommendation
This directory can be **safely deleted**. It served its purpose during the merge process and is no longer needed.
