# docs2/ - OBSOLETE

This directory contains **superseded documentation** from a pre-merge state.

## Contents (All Obsolete)
- `VISION.md` → Superseded by [../docs/VISION.md](../docs/VISION.md)
- `ROADMAP-ours.md` → Superseded by [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)
- `UI_PHILOSOPHY.md` → Content merged into [../docs/epics/E003-tethered-canvas-ui.md](../docs/epics/E003-tethered-canvas-ui.md)
- `types-additions.ts` → Should be in src/, not docs
- `types-additions.patch` → Temporary file

## Recommendation
This directory can be **safely deleted**. All valuable content has been merged into the main documentation structure.

See [../docs3/00-MERGE-SUMMARY.md](../docs3/00-MERGE-SUMMARY.md) for details on the merge process.
